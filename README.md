Market segmentation is the process of breaking a large consumer or company market into smaller consumer groups (known as segments) based on similar criteria. Often, this process involves existing and future clients.

In order to divide or segment markets, researchers frequently look for shared traits including mutual wants, same hobbies, comparable lifestyles, or even comparable demographic profiles.
